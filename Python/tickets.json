All I'm asking is if I can get my VPS reset and working with 95 hours left, or a refund, since I haven't been able to use the VPS.","priority":null,"status":"closed","recipient":null,"requester_id":17785152054301,"submitter_id":17785152054301,"assignee_id":1908275978753,"organization_id":null,"group_id":4686110835101,"collaborator_ids":[],"follower_ids":[],"email_cc_ids":[],"forum_topic_id":null,"problem_id":null,"has_incidents":false,"is_public":true,"due_at":null,"tags":[],"custom_fields":[],"satisfaction_rating":{"score":"unoffered"},"sharing_agreement_ids":[],"custom_status_id":4686110834589,"encoded_id":"VKLZ24-2ZK7Z","fields":[],"followup_ids":[],"brand_id":4686110821661,"allow_channelback":false,"allow_attachments":true,"from_messaging_channel":false},{"url":"https://apponfly6713.zendesk.com/api/v2/tickets/1555.json","id":1555,"external_id":null,"via":{"channel":"web","source":{"from":{},"to":{},"rel":null}},"created_at":"2024-03-29T15:15:03Z","updated_at":"2024-04-03T20:01:35Z","generated_timestamp":1712174495,"type":null,"subject":"help","raw_subject":"help","description":"not working and it take forever i took a screen shoot","priority":null,"status":"closed","recipient":null,"requester_id":15697181884829,"submitter_id":15697181884829,"assignee_id":1908275978753,"organization_id":null,"group_id":4686110835101,"collaborator_ids":[],"follower_ids":[],"email_cc_ids":[],"forum_topic_id":null,"problem_id":null,"has_incidents":false,"is_public":true,"due_at":null,"tags":[],"custom_fields":[],"satisfaction_rating":{"score":"unoffered"},"sharing_agreement_ids":[],"custom_status_id":4686110834589,"encoded_id":"42GX61-7D0K4","fields":[],"followup_ids":[],"brand_id":4686110821661,"allow_channelback":false,"allow_attachments":true,"from_messaging_channel":false},{"url":"https://apponfly6713.zendesk.com/api/v2/tickets/1543.json","id":1543,"external_id":null,"via":{"channel":"web","source":{"from":{},"to":{},"rel":null}},"created_at":"2024-03-27T02:17:29Z","updated_at":"2024-04-03T20:01:36Z","generated_timestamp":1712174496,"type":null,"subject":"refund","raw_subject":"refund","description":"Hello I have made a purchase of rdp\nMy work requires that I run VPN programs\nBut the first program automatically rejects the connection\nSecondly, after turning it on, the rdp no longer works\nCan I get the money back?","priority":null,"status":"closed","recipient":null,"requester_id":17808597164701,"submitter_id":17808597164701,"assignee_id":1908275978753,"organization_id":null,"group_id":4686110835101,"collaborator_ids":[],"follower_ids":[],"email_cc_ids":[],"forum_topic_id":null,"problem_id":null,"has_incidents":false,"is_public":true,"due_at":null,"tags":[],"custom_fields":[],"satisfaction_rating":{"score":"unoffered"},"sharing_agreement_ids":[],"custom_status_id":4686110834589,"encoded_id":"9K3NMZ-EX5KE","fields":[],"followup_ids":[],"brand_id":4686110821661,"allow_channelback":false,"allow_attachments":true,"from_messaging_channel":false},{"url":"https://apponfly6713.zendesk.com/api/v2/tickets/1549.json","id":1549,"external_id":null,"via":{"channel":"web","source":{"from":{},"to":{},"rel":null}},"created_at":"2024-03-28T22:58:56Z","updated_at":"2024-04-03T20:01:36Z","generated_timestamp":1712174496,"type":null,"subject":"Free Trials Do Not Work","raw_subject":"Free Trials Do Not Work","description":"Hello, I have a question about your free trials.

For some reason on my hannah account It says 50 hours when I haven't logged In since possibly last week or a few days ago only to be on It briefly. I also had It shutdown everytime I got done using It or It'll automatically shutdown If I take too long (which I'm fine with since It saves my hours). My Samantha account only has 10 hours on It which should be about the same hours on my Hannah account. I gave the Samantha account to my brother and as far as I know, he also haven't been using It much either and the hours on that account are correct.\n\nOn my Hannah account I payed $24 on April 13th at 11:53 PM and I know I only used up 9-10 hours from when I last logged In (which was like maybe a week or 3-4 days ago). Most of April I didn't use the emulator because I didn't need It at that time until now. I have tests coming up and I'm disappointed that the hours jumped up when I haven't been on for that long.\n\n ![](https://apponfly6713.zendesk.com/attachments/token/ljRFtq31PyYXny9jQhTx2MyQR/?name=Screenshot+2024-05-19+4.28.43+AM.png) ![](https://apponfly6713.zendesk.com/attachments/token/E2SgB6EDhf8RH09ITWClfiMQE/?name=Screenshot+2024-05-19+4.29.17+AM.png)\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd this screenshot Is of the first purchase I made on March 26th at 12:48 PM for my Samantha account of when I tested to see If this was a good purchase.\n\n\n\nHere's a screenshot I took today when I logged In at 2:33 am.

I was gonna use It to download an app I needed on the emulator.\n\n![](https://apponfly6713.zendesk.com/attachments/token/zRWHE3D1ArevKLE6gi0oNQmAE/?name=Screenshot+2024-05-19+2.33.37+AM.png) I don't know what happened here nor how the hours jumped up like this. I have the amount of times I actually logged In. If you also have logs recorded of when and how long I was on It then I'd like to see It (Just In case If my account got compromised).","priority":null,"status":"closed","recipient":null,"requester_id":18962583229085,"submitter_id":18962583229085,"assignee_id":1908275978753,"organization_id":null,"group_id":4686110835101,"collaborator_ids":[],"follower_ids":[],"email_cc_ids":[],"forum_topic_id":null,"problem_id":null,"has_incidents":false,"is_public":true,"due_at":null,"tags":[],"custom_fields":[],"satisfaction_rating":{"score":"unoffered"},"sharing_agreement_ids":[],"custom_status_id":4686110834589,"encoded_id":"V69KLW-YWL0E","fields":[],"followup_ids":[],"brand_id":4686110821661,"allow_channelback":false,"allow_attachments":true,"from_messaging_channel":false},{"url":"https://apponfly6713.zendesk.com/api/v2/tickets/1664.json","id":1664,"external_id":null,"via":{"channel":"web","source":{"from":{},"to":{},"rel":null}},"created_at":"2024-05-23T13:55:31Z","updated_at":"2024-05-28T14:01:44Z","generated_timestamp":1716904904,"type":null,"subject":"The windows vps i purchased is way too laggy.

I am writing to request a refund for my subscription fees and to cancel my subscription to your service, UpOnFly.\n\nI was unaware that $11.9 USD was being charged monthly, as it wasn't clearly shown to me until today. Upon reviewing the situation, I realized that I've spent a total of $59.5 USD for the months of June, July, August, September, and October without actively using the service. This amount is significant for me, as I live in Morocco, and I feel that I have wasted this money.\n\nPlease feel free to check your records to verify how many days I actually used the site. I believe you will find that I have not been using the service for these months. I kindly request a refund for the unused months, (June, July, August, September, and October) as this is a real financial burden for me.\n\nI greatly appreciate your time and consideration, and I hope you will review the data regarding my usage and help me with this refund.\n\nPlease find the files uploaded.\n\nBest regards,\nHassan Abali","priority":null,"status":"closed","recipient":null,"requester_id":18640234351901,"submitter_id":18640234351901,"assignee_id":1908275978753,"organization_id":null,"group_id":4686110835101,"collaborator_ids":[22045150480285],"follower_ids":[],"email_cc_ids":[22045150480285],"forum_topic_id":null,"problem_id":null,"has_incidents":false,"is_public":true,"due_at":null,"tags":[],"custom_fields":[],"satisfaction_rating":{"score":"unoffered"},"sharing_agreement_ids":[],"custom_status_id":4686110834589,"encoded_id":"VDDKW1-5WMNE","fields":[],"followup_ids":[],"brand_id":4686110821661,"allow_channelback":false,"allow_attachments":true,"from_messaging_channel":false},{"url":"https://apponfly6713.zendesk.com/api/v2/tickets/1962.json","id":1962,"external_id":null,"via":{"channel":"email","source":{"from":{"address":"matilde.gorgone@ovb.it","name":"Matilde Gorgone"},"to":{"name":"AppOnFly","address":"support@apponfly.com"},"rel":null}},"created_at":"2024-10-08T12:58:03Z","updated_at":"2024-10-12T16:01:18Z","generated_timestamp":1728748878,"type":null,"subject":"Subscription User Mattia Zattarin","raw_subject":"Subscription User Mattia Zattarin","description":"Hello,\n\n \n\ncan you please create a new subscription for the user Mattia Zattarin?\n\n \n\nKind regards,\n\nMatilde Gorgone\n\n \n\nOVB Consulenza Patrimoniale srl\n\nStradone San Fermo, 19 - 37121 Verona\n\n\nTel: +39 045 8037070   \n\nEmail:matilde.gorgone@ovb.it | Web: www.ovb.it (http://www.ovb.it/)\n\nVenite a trovarci anche su  Facebook (https://m.facebook.com/OVBItalia/) e Linkedin (https://www.linkedin.com/company/ovb-consulenza-patrimoniale-italia/)\n\n \n\nLe informazioni contenute nella presente e-mail e i relativi allegati sono riservati esclusivamente alle persone o alla Società sopraindicati.\n\nLa diffusione, comunicazione e/o copia del contenuto della e-mail e dei documenti trasmessi da parte di qualsiasi soggetto diverso dal destinatario è vietata ai sensi dell'art. 616 c.p. e del Regolamento UE 2016/679.\n\nSe avete ricevuto questo messaggio per errore, vi preghiamo di distruggerlo e di informarci immediatamente per telefono ai numeri sopra indicati o inviando un messaggio al presente indirizzo e-mail.","priority":null,"status":"closed","recipient":"support@apponfly.com","requester_id":21004999898269,"submitter_id":21004999898269,"assignee_id":1908275978753,"organization_id":null,"group_id":4686110835101,"collaborator_ids":[20275249501597,20275350968093],"follower_ids":[],"email_cc_ids":[20275249501597,20275350968093],"forum_topic_id":null,"problem_id":null,"has_incidents":false,"is_public":true,"due_at":null,"tags":[],"custom_fields":[],"satisfaction_rating":{"score":"unoffered"},"sharing_agreement_ids":[],"custom_status_id":4686110834589,"encoded_id":"GDDRD1-YKYPZ","fields":[],"followup_ids":[],"brand_id":4686110821661,"allow_channelback":false,"allow_attachments":true,"from_messaging_channel":false},{"url":"https://apponfly6713.zendesk.com/api/v2/tickets/1963.json","id":1963,"external_id":null,"via":{"channel":"web","source":{"from":{},"to":{},"rel":null}},"created_at":"2024-10-08T17:01:34Z","updated_at":"2024-10-14T08:02:32Z","generated_timestamp":1728892952,"type":null,"subject":"Doubt in RDP system ","raw_subject":"Doubt in RDP system ","description":"Hi sir/mam\n\nThis is Jack Will And i have one doubt about i am able to change RDP ip as i want is that possible ???

I’ve been a customer of your Windows VPS service, and I chose AppOnFly because I trusted you guys to deliver. I mean, your support team is all over the globe, and with offices in San Francisco and Prague, I figured you’d have everything dialed in to make things work for someone like me in North Carolina. But right now, I’m stuck with a server in the Czech Republic, and it’s making my life miserable.\n\nThe connection from here to there is awful slow as hell, laggy, and basically unusable. I can’t enjoy the plan I’m paying for, and it’s driving me nuts. I know you’ve got the know how and the reach to fix this. Please, I’m begging you relocate my server somewhere closer to North Carolina, like one of your U.S. spots. San Francisco’s your home base, right? That’d be a game changer for me. I just need something that doesn’t make me feel like I’m shouting across an ocean to get a response.\n\nYou’re my lifeline here. I’ve been rooting for AppOnFly, telling people how great you _could_ be for me, and I don’t want to give up on you. But if this keeps dragging on, I’m scared I’ll have to walk away and I’d hate that. You’ve got a global team that’s supposed to point me in the right direction, so please, point me to a server that actually works for where I am. I’m counting on your expertise and your care for customers like me to pull through.\n\nCan you make this happen? Soon? Every day with this lag is killing me, and I need to hear back fast.
