Is gaming possible on the silver plan?,"I wanted to play Elden Ring on the VPS. Here are the system requirements for the game:

- CPU: Intel Core i5-8400 | AMD Ryzen 3 3300X.
- RAM: 12 GB

Will the Silver plan be able to run the game? 8 GB ran isn't a problem but I was wondering about the CPU. And will there be any lag? I ran a speedtest and got 80 mbps download and 90 mbps upload. Will that be enough to ensure that the game doesnt lag? It's a fast-paced action RPG with fights so I really don't want my attacks to execute 2 seconds after I press the keys on my keyboard.



Thanks"

I only used it for 1 hour total, and then it was kinda glitchy, so I factory reset it the next day, and ever since Thursday the 21st, it's been spinning (factory resetting) And I guess a VPS resetting counts as usage time, since it seems that I have 0 hours left, even though i had around 5 hours used (4 hours were the VPS just idle).

Considering purchase - inquiry,"Dear Sir/Madam,

I am considering purchasing the ‘Windows VPS - 4CPU, 16GB RAM, 250GB SSD’ @250hours service and I was wondering if it would be possible to get a trial run of this variant. The regular trial is capped at 1CPU 2GB RAM which is why I want to upgrade to the fastest tier and I would like to see how smooth it runs before I purchase it - would this be possible? The trial doesn't have to be long as I just want to see how it feels, I'd even be satisfied with a few minutes (<5 mins).

I hope to hear from you soon!

Kind regards,

My hours went up even though I haven't been using It regularly.,"I have 2 accounts I use for the emulator. 1 Is on my SamanthalWilliams509@gmail.com and the other one Is the one I'm on now hannahbaker0991@gmail.com. On my Samantha account I (for a test) payed for the $6 for 100 hours of the [Windows VPS - 1CPU, 2GB RAM, 50GB SSD] and on this accoun (Hannah) I am paying the $24 for 100 hours of the [Windows VPS - 4CPU, 16GB RAM, 250GB SSD]. For some reason on my hannah account It says 50 hours when I haven't logged In since possibly last week or a few days ago only to be on It briefly. I also had It shutdown everytime I got done using It or It'll automatically shutdown If I take too long (which I'm fine with since It saves my hours). My Samantha account only has 10 hours on It which should be about the same hours on my Hannah account. I gave the Samantha account to my brother and as far as I know, he also haven't been using It much either and the hours on that account are correct.

On my Hannah account I payed $24 on April 13th at 11:53 PM and I know I only used up 9-10 hours from when I last logged In (which was like maybe a week or 3-4 days ago). Most of April I didn't use the emulator because I didn't need It at that time until now. I have tests coming up and I'm disappointed that the hours jumped up when I haven't been on for that long.

And this screenshot Is of the first purchase I made on March 26th at 12:48 PM for my Samantha account of when I tested to see If this was a good purchase.



Here's a screenshot I took today when I logged In at 2:33 am. It shows 50 hours when It should be like 9 - 10 hours at least. I was gonna use It to download an app I needed on the emulator.

Request for Clarification on Virtual Machine Resource Sharing,"Dear Customer Service

Good morning,

I am writing to you regarding my subscription with your service. I would like to express my satisfaction with how the virtual machine operates. However, I would like to request some clarifications regarding the potential sharing of the virtual machine with other users.

I use Amazon's KDP platform, which has strict policies against having two KDP accounts on the same computer, resulting in an immediate ban and account closure. I only have one KDP account, but last week I received a ban notice stating that I have two accounts.

I would like to know if it is possible for some users to share the same IP address or MAC address of the virtual machine. This information is crucial for understanding the reason behind the closure of my Amazon account for allegedly having a duplicate account.

Please provide a clear and detailed response so I can resolve this issue with Amazon.

Thank you for your attention. I look forward to your response.

Best regards,

Re: AppOnFly usage summary - September 2022,"Hi support,

I have not used my account in some time though continued to pay monthly charges.  I just needed to use a saved database, but find that I cannot open it either in Access or from the desktop.  Properties show that the database may be closed due to import from another device.  I did check “unblock” which did not resolve the problem, though it did no longer have the security notice. 

I have given AppOnFly customer support access to this database.

These issues are severely impacting my ability to use the service effectively.

Additionally, I would like to know if it is possible to change my server location to potentially improve performance.

Verification of Virtual Machine Usage Hours,"I hope everything is going well at ApponFly. I am writing regarding the calculation of the usage hours for my virtual machine. Although I connect only for a few minutes each week, I have noticed with concern that the hours seem to accumulate much faster than expected. Therefore, I believe there might be an error in the calculation.

I would appreciate it if you could conduct an accurate verification of the usage hours. Additionally, could you please provide me with a detailed explanation of how these hours are calculated?

I want to emphasize that I always make sure to properly shut down the virtual machine at the end of each session. However, I still have concerns that there may be an issue with the hour calculation.

Thank you in advance for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your response.

Request for Device ID and Configuration Reset on VPS,"Dear AppOnFly Support Team,

I hope this message finds you well.

I am currently using your VPS service, and I have encountered a situation where I need to reset or change the device identifiers (such as Device ID, MAC address, IP address, etc.) associated with my virtual machine. After performing several factory resets, it appears that certain device configurations are not being fully reset, and this is affecting my ability to use specific services.

Could you please assist me in:

- Changing or resetting the device identifiers (Device ID, MAC address, and other relevant identifiers).
- Reassigning a new IP address to my VPS instance.
- Ensuring that my VPS is treated as a completely fresh machine after a reset.

If there are any additional steps I need to follow to accomplish this or if there are limitations related to my plan, kindly let me know.

I appreciate your assistance and look forward to your response.

Best regards,

Refund,"Dear Apponfly,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to request a refund for my subscription fees and to cancel my subscription to your service, UpOnFly.

I was unaware that $11.9 USD was being charged monthly, as it wasn't clearly shown to me until today. Upon reviewing the situation, I realized that I've spent a total of $59.5 USD for the months of June, July, August, September, and October (Today)  without actively using the service. This amount is significant for me, as I live in Morocco, and I feel that I have wasted this money.

Please feel free to check your records to verify how many days I actually used the site. I believe you will find that I have not been using the service for these months. I kindly request a refund for the unused months, as this is a real financial burden for me.

I greatly appreciate your time and consideration, and I hope you will review the data regarding my usage and help me with this refund.

VPS Suggestion,"Greetings,

I am a sports photographer in search of a VPS where I can leave the apps (lightroom) processing.

My aging computer is struggling during the exports, taking around 5s each photo, which sums into hours each day of shooting.

I am considering in getting an hourly rated VPS, since I will only need it running some hours each week, but would like to question if is possible to test the export times on it



Will be waiting for your reply

Thank you in advance"

WINDOWS 10 VPS,"Good morning,

I have a company and would like to use your services. We are a technology company in Portugal and would like to try your system for 1 month to test and verify if it is possible to do what we want.

I would like to know if it is possible to install only Windows 10 on the VPS?

I would like to know if for example the price of 2 CPUs, 8 GB RAM, 100 GB SSD for $12 (100 hours per year $12) what does that mean? I have 100 hours for 1 year and that will cost $12?

If I exceed 100 hours, what will be the price per hour?

I await your feedback.

Thank you.

Best regards,
Daniel Barreira"

Request for Custom Proxy Configuration on VPS  ,"Dear Team,

I am interested in purchasing a Windows VPS from your service and have a specific requirement. I have my own proxy with a dedicated IP, and I would like the VPS to use this proxy IP at the system level before I access it.

This means the VPS should be pre-configured to route all traffic through my proxy so that the proxy IP is visible without requiring any additional setup while I use your VPS product.

I will provide the details of my proxy:
- Proxy IP
- Port
- Authentication (Username & Password)

Please let me know if this is something your team can configure during the VPS setup. If possible, I would also appreciate any additional details or steps required to make this happen.

Thank you for your assistance, and I look forward to your response.

Best regards,
Arthur Dal

Urgent: Please Help Me Get My Server Closer to NC,"Dear AppOnFly Customer Support Team,

I’m reaching out because I’m really struggling here and I need your help badly. I’ve been a customer of your Windows VPS service, and I chose AppOnFly because I trusted you guys to deliver. I mean, your support team is all over the globe, and with offices in San Francisco and Prague, I figured you’d have everything dialed in to make things work for someone like me in North Carolina. But right now, I’m stuck with a server in the Czech Republic, and it’s making my life miserable.

The connection from here to there is awful slow as hell, laggy, and basically unusable. I can’t enjoy the plan I’m paying for, and it’s driving me nuts. I know you’ve got the know how and the reach to fix this. Please, I’m begging you relocate my server somewhere closer to North Carolina, like one of your U.S. spots. San Francisco’s your home base, right? That’d be a game changer for me. I just need something that doesn’t make me feel like I’m shouting across an ocean to get a response.

You’re my lifeline here. I’ve been rooting for AppOnFly, telling people how great you _could_ be for me, and I don’t want to give up on you. But if this keeps dragging on, I’m scared I’ll have to walk away and I’d hate that. You’ve got a global team that’s supposed to point me in the right direction, so please, point me to a server that actually works for where I am. I’m counting on your expertise and your care for customers like me to pull through.

Can you make this happen? Soon? Every day with this lag is killing me, and I need to hear back fast. Thanks for being the amazing team I know you are I’m trusting you to save the day."

Vps Auto-hours Consumption,"Hello , SO i brought 3 rdps in this account (manobhavsuman@gmail.com) and also i used them yesterday too the hours consumed was arround 14 , 12 ,0 and now when i logined it again today it says hours consumed 96 , 91 , 90.

Security,"We are thinking about signing up for your silver or gold tier, we were concerned about what happens with our virtual system when we are complete. Do you purge these virtual systems? Are they deleted along with the data? What is the process? Thank you!"
Vps Auto-hours Consumption,"I didn't received any prior notice about **Minimum Monthly Commitment.**

And I had 3 vps of 100+ hours each and yesterday the hours consumption was 12 , 14 , 0 and  now within 1 day of time frame it is 90+ in all my vps.

Deducting that much period from my vps is what I can't even understand and if this was  to be done on monthly basis than what is the point of deducting it retroactively if done previous before and even in my case I was not even notified about this changes.

So please i request regarding this concern as reducing 240 hours in just one day from all my 3 vps of 100 hours each is not acceptable .
Thankyou"
Regarding Auto-Consumption,"It's a big loss for me and i literally brought 3 vps of 100hours each and if it would have been deducted on monthly basis like 10 hours per month than i would have got to know about that earlier and I would have lost only around 30 hours but deducting after 8 months of all the months at once is not understandable.

So,  please based on these concerns help me I paid for 3 vps and literally 90% of the hours got vanished in a single day without even using it. It's a big loss for me so please help
Thankyou"

info request about vps minutes,"hi,

I would like to subscribe a flexible vps plan.

I need to understand how vps usage minutes are calculated.

If I install a software for my needs on the vps and get connected for 4-5 hours a day,

is my daily usage will be counted 4-5 hours or since I need to keep files on vps and because of that my usage will be counted as 24 hours for each day even there will be days I will not use vps.

lastly, I do not mean a software will serve through web which will keep vps up and running.

thanks."

Are you maybe able to resolve this or tell me why this issue occured? Because I am not sure if I done something wrong or if you should just fix that. Thanks in advance! :)

2. Your VPS server turns off after I disconnect from it. Is there maybe an option to actually keep ti running 24/7 even if noone actively uses it? I consider running some python test scripts there overnight etc - I wonder if that's okay with your ToS i.e. running VPS 24/7

"Urgent: VPS Stuck in ""Starting"" Mode - Account: mjdsafishahi@gmail.com","Dear AppOnFly Support Team,

I am writing to report a critical issue with my Windows VPS (1CPU, 2GB RAM, 50GB SSD). For several hours, the server has been stuck in the ""Starting"" mode and will not proceed to a running state, making it completely inaccessible.

As you can see from the screenshot I've attached (and my account's dashboard), my usage timer is currently at 61 hours, which indicates how long this issue has been ongoing while my paid time is being consumed.

This is the second time I have encountered this exact problem. During the previous occurrence, I lost approximately 8 hours of service time before the issue was resolved. This recurring problem is significantly impacting my work and my confidence in the service.

I kindly request that you investigate this issue urgently and get my VPS running again. Furthermore, considering this is a repeated issue and the significant amount of time lost (both in this instance and the previous one), I would like to request a credit to my account for the time the VPS has been unusable.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

Majid

I connect to your VPS on my android tablet. I only have this issue when I connect to your service. When I hold just for a second backspace/delete button, it continues to act as if it was held down all the time thus deleting more than just one sign - until I press ‘space’ or another button to stop it.

I understand you might not know the answer for this one and you might not be responsible for this - but have u maybe heard or know of such an issue and do you know how I could fix that maybe?

Thanks in advance for your answer.

I am using the Apponfly subscription, I have the weakest/smallest/cheapst package where you buy 100 hours.

I am doing some scraping work and I have the problem that after 1 hour of scraping or something, the virtual machine crashes. IS it because of the RAM limitation or something like that maybe? Would it not happen anymore if I subscribe to a stronger package?"
